GPIO controlled media player for Raspberry Pi 4 using libvlc and gtk+3

Hi folks

this is a project to have a fullscreen media player on Raspb 4 using libvlc and gtk+3
challenges solved here are fullscreen playback with black in the background
looping of media files in VLC

will be happy if anyone has suggestions how to improve the code! :)

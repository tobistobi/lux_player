GPIO controlled media player for Raspberry Pi 4 using libvlc and gtk+3

Hi folks

this is a project to have a fullscreen media player on Raspb 4 using libvlc and gtk+3 <br>

features:<br>
- Plays two video files based on sensor input (closed / open) <br>
- Uses LJ8A3-2-Z/BX 5V Inductive NPN Sensor<br>
- Fullscreen video playback, loops over black<br>
- Debug mode<br>

will be happy if anyone has suggestions how to improve the code! :)
